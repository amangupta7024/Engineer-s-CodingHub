        <h2>Network</h2>
        <p>
          A network is a set of devices that are connected with a physical media
          link. In a network, two or more nodes are connected by a physical link
          or two or more networks are connected by one or more nodes. A network
          is a collection of devices connected to each other to allow the
          sharing of data.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Network Topology</h2>
        <p>
          Network topology specifies the layout of a computer network. It shows
          how devices and cables are connected to each other.
        </p>
        <div class="topology">
          <h3>Star</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Star topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are
              connected to a single device known as a central device.
            </li>
            <!-- <li>
              Star topology requires more cable compared to other topologies.
              Therefore, it is more robust as a failure in one cable will only
              disconnect a specific computer connected to this cable.
            </li> -->
            <li>
              If the central device is damaged, then the whole network fails.
            </li>
            <li>
              Star topology is very easy to install, manage and troubleshoot. It
              is commonly used in office and home networks.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="topology">
          <h3>Ring</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Ring topology is a network topology in which nodes are exactly
              connected to two or more nodes.
            </li>
            <li>
              It does not need any central server to control the connectivity
              among the nodes.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the single node is damaged, then the whole network fails.
            </li>
            <!-- <li>
              Ring topology is very rarely used as it is expensive, difficult to
              install and manage.
            </li> -->
            <li>
              Examples of Ring topology are SONET network, SDH network, etc.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="topology">
          <h3>Bus</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Bus topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are
              connected to a single cable known as a central cable or bus.
            </li>
            <li>
              It acts as a shared communication medium, i.e., if any device
              wants to send the data to other devices, then it will send the
              data over the bus which in turn sends the data to all the attached
              devices.
            </li>
            <li>Bus topology is useful for a small number of devices.</li>
            <li>As if the bus is damaged then the whole network fails.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="topology">
          <h3>Mesh</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Mesh topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are
              individually connected to other nodes.
            </li>

            <li>
              It does not need any central switch or hub to control the
              connectivity among the nodes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mesh topology is categorized into two parts: Fully connected mesh
              topology: In this topology, all the nodes are connected to each
              other. Partially connected mesh topology: In this topology, all
              the nodes are not connected to each other.
            </li>
            <!-- <li>
              It is robust as a failure in one cable will only disconnect the
              specified computer connected to this cable.
            </li>
            <li>
              topology is rarely used as installation and configuration are
              difficult when connectivity gets more.
            </li> -->
            <li>Cabling cost is high as it requires bulk wiring.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="topology">
          <h3>Tree</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Tree topology is a combination of star and bus topology. It is
              also known as the expanded star topology.
            </li>
            <li>
              In tree topology, all the star networks are connected to a single
              bus.
            </li>
            <li>Ethernet protocol is used in this topology.</li>
            <li>
              In this, the whole network is divided into segments known as star
              networks which can be easily maintained. If one segment is
              damaged, there is no effect on other segments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tree topology depends on the "main bus," and if it breaks, then
              the whole network gets damaged
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="topology">
          <h3>Hybrid</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A hybrid topology is a combination of different topologies to form
              a resulting topology.
            </li>
            <li>
              If star topology is connected with another star topology, then it
              remains a star topology. If star topology is connected with
              different topology, then it becomes a Hybrid topology.
            </li>
            <li>
              It provides flexibility as it can be implemented in a different
              network environment.
            </li>

        <h2>VPN (Virtual Private Network)</h2>
        <p>
          VPN or the Virtual Private Network is a private WAN (Wide Area
          Network) built on the internet. It allows the creation of a secured
          tunnel (protected network) between different networks using the
          internet (public network). By using the VPN, a client can connect to
          the organization's network remotely.
        </p>
        <h3>Advantages of VPN</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            VPN is used to connect offices in different geographical locations
            remotely and is cheaper when compared to WAN connections.
          </li>
          <li>
            VPN is used for secure transactions and confidential data transfer
            between multiple offices located in different geographical
            locations.
          </li>
          <li>
            VPN keeps an organization's information secured against any
            potential threats or intrusions by using virtualization.
          </li>
          <li>
            VPN encrypts the internet traffic and disguises the online identity.

        <p>
          An IP address is a 32-bit dynamic address of a node in the network. An
          IPv4 address has 4 octets of 8-bit each with each number with a value
          up to 255. IPv4 classes are differentiated based on the number of
          hosts it supports on the network. There are five types of IPv4 classes
          and are based on the first octet of IP addresses which are classified
          as Class A, B, C, D, or E.

        <h2>IPv6 Address</h2>
        <p>
          IPv6 is the latest Internet Protocol version, replacing IPv4. It
          offers many more addresses (128-bit) and simplifies network
          communication. IPv6 supports automatic setup, improves security, and
          enhances performance by using multicast instead of broadcast.
          Transition methods like Dual Stack and Tunneling help move from IPv4
          to IPv6. While it provides better performance and supports more
          devices, transitioning requires updates and training.

          HTTP is the HyperText Transfer Protocol which defines the set of rules
          and standards on how the information can be transmitted on the World
          Wide Web (WWW). It helps the web browsers and web servers for
          communication. It is a 'stateless protocol' where each command is
          independent with respect to the previous command. HTTP is an
          application layer protocol built upon the TCP. It uses port 80 by
          default.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTTPS is the HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure or Secure HTTP. It is
          an advanced and secured version of HTTP. On top of HTTP, SSL/TLS
          protocol is used to provide security. It enables secure transactions
          by encrypting the communication and also helps identify network
          servers securely. It uses port 443 by default.

        <h2>DNS (Domain Name System)</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            DNS is an acronym that stands for Domain Name System. DNS was
            introduced by Paul Mockapetris and Jon Postel in 1983.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is a naming system for all the resources over the internet which
            includes physical nodes and applications. It is used to locate
            resources easily over a network.
          </li>
          <li>
            DNS is an internet which maps the domain names to their associated
            IP addresses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Without DNS, users must know the IP address of the web page that you
            wanted to access.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Working of DNS</h3>
        <p>
          If you want to visit the website of "shaurya", then the user will type
          "https://www.shaurya.com" into the address bar of the web browser.
          Once the domain name is entered, then the domain name system will
          translate the domain name into the IP address which can be easily
          interpreted by the computer. Using the IP address, the computer can
          locate the web page requested by the user.
        </p>

        <h3>DNS Forwarder</h3>
        <p>
          A forwarder is used with a DNS server when it receives DNS queries
          that cannot be resolved quickly. So it forwards those requests to
          external DNS servers for resolution. A DNS server which is configured
          as a forwarder will behave differently than the DNS server which is
          not configured as a forwarder.

        </h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, whereas UDP is a
            connectionless protocol. A key difference between TCP and UDP is
            speed, as TCP is comparatively slower than UDP. Overall, UDP is a
            much faster, simpler, and efficient protocol, however,
            retransmission of lost data packets is only possible with TCP.
          </li>
          <li>
            TCP provides extensive error checking mechanisms. It is because it
            provides flow control and acknowledgment of data. UDP has only the
            basic error checking mechanism using checksums.

        <h2>Important Protocols</h2>
        <p>A protocol is a set of rules which is used to govern all the aspects of information communication. The main elements of a protocol are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Syntax:</strong> It specifies the structure or format of the data. It also specifies the order in which they are presented.</li>
          <li><strong>Semantics:</strong> It specifies the meaning of each section of bits.</li>
          <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Timing specifies two characteristics: When data should be sent and how fast it can be sent.</li>
        </ol>
      
        <h3>DHCP</h3>
        <p>DHCP is the <strong>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</strong>. It is an application layer protocol used to auto-configure devices on IP networks enabling them to use the TCP and UDP-based protocols. The DHCP servers auto-assign the IPs and other network configurations to the devices individually which enables them to communicate over the IP network. It helps to get the subnet mask, IP address and helps to resolve the DNS. It uses port 67 by default.</p>
      
        <h3>SMTP</h3>
        <p>
          SMTP is the <strong>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</strong>. SMTP sets the rule for
          communication between servers. This set of rules helps the software to
          transmit emails over the internet. It supports both End-to-End and
          Store-and-Forward methods. It is in always-listening mode on port 25.
        </p>
        <h3>FTP</h3>
        <p>FTP is a <strong> File Transfer Protocol</strong>. It is an application layer protocol used to transfer files and data reliably and efficiently between hosts. It can also be used to download files from remote servers to your computer. It uses port 27 by default.</p>
      
        <h3>ICMP</h3>
        <p>ICMP is the <strong>Internet Control Message Protocol</strong>. It is a network layer protocol used for error handling. It is mainly used by network devices like routers for diagnosing the network connection issues and crucial for error reporting and testing if the data is reaching the preferred destination in time. It uses port 7 by default.</p>
      
        <h3>ARP</h3>
        <p>ARP is <strong>Address Resolution Protocol</strong>. It is a network-level protocol used to convert the logical address i.e. IP address to the device's physical address i.e. MAC address. It can also be used to get the MAC address of devices when they are trying to communicate over the local network.</p>
      
        <h3>RIP</h3>
        <p>RIP stands for <strong>Routing Information Protocol</strong>. It is accessed by the routers to send data from one network to another. RIP is a dynamic protocol which is used to find the best route from source to the destination over a network by using the hop count algorithm. Routers use this protocol to exchange the network topology information. This protocol can be used by small or medium-sized networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Hub:</strong> Hub is a networking device which is used to transmit the signal to each port (except one port) to respond from which the signal was received. Hub is operated on a Physical layer. In this packet filtering is not available. It is of two types: Active Hub, Passive Hub.</p>
            <p><strong>Switch:</strong> Switch is a network device which is used to enable the connection establishment and connection termination on the basis of need. Switch is operated on the Data link layer. In this packet filtering is available. It is a type of full duplex transmission mode and it is also called an efficient bridge.</p>
          </li>
          <li>A subnet is a network inside a network achieved by the process called subnetting which helps divide a network into subnets. It is used for getting a higher routing efficiency and enhances the security of the network. It reduces the time to extract the host address from the routing table.
          </li>
          <li>
            The reliability of a network can be measured by the following factors:
            <ul>
              <li>Downtime: The downtime is defined as the required time to recover.</li>
              <li>Failure Frequency: It is the frequency when it fails to work the way it is intended.</li>
              <li>Catastrophe: It indicates that the network has been attacked by some unexpected event such as fire, earthquake.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            There are mainly two criteria which make a network effective and efficient:
              <li>Performance: Performance can be measured in many ways like transmit time and response time.</li>
              <li>Reliability: Reliability is measured by frequency of failure.</li>
              <li>Robustness: Robustness specifies the quality or condition of being strong and in good condition.</li>
              <li>Security: It specifies how to protect data from unauthorized access and viruses.</li>
          
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Node and Link:</strong> A network is a connection setup of two or more computers directly connected by some physical mediums like optical fiber or coaxial cable. This physical medium of connection is known as a link, and the computers that it is connected to are known as nodes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gateway and Router:</strong> A node that is connected to two or more networks is commonly known as a gateway. It is also known as a router. It is used to forward messages from one network to another. Both the gateway and router regulate the traffic in the network. Differences between gateway and router: A router sends the data between two similar networks while gateway sends the data between two dissimilar networks.
          </li>
          <li>
          <strong>NIC (Imp):</strong> NIC stands for Network Interface Card. It is a peripheral card attached to the PC to connect to a network. Every NIC has its own MAC address that identifies the PC on the network. It provides a wireless connection to a local area network. NICs were mainly used in desktop computers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>POP3:</strong> POP3 stands for Post Office Protocol version3. POP is responsible for accessing the mail service on a client machine. POP3 works on two models such as Delete mode and Keep mode.
          </li>
    
            <p><strong>Private IP Address:</strong> There are three ranges of IP addresses that have been reserved for IP addresses. They are not valid for use on the internet. If you want to access the internet on these private IPs, you must use a proxy server or NAT server.</p>
            <p><strong>Public IP Address:</strong> A public IP address is an address taken by the Internet Service Provider which facilitates communication on the internet.</p>
          
          <li>
            <strong>RAID:</strong> RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive/Independent Disks) is a method to provide Fault Tolerance by using multiple Hard Disc Drives.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Netstat:</strong> It is a command line utility program. It gives useful information about the current TCP/IP setting of a connection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ping:</strong> The "ping" is a utility program that allows you to check the connectivity between the network devices. You can ping devices using its IP address or name.
          </li>
          <li>
            The processes on each machine that communicate at a given layer are called peer-peer processes (P2P).
          </li>
        
            <p><strong>Unicasting:</strong> If the message is sent to a single node from the source then it is known as unicasting. This is commonly used in networks to establish a new connection.</p>
            <p><strong>Anycasting:</strong> If the message is sent to any of the nodes from the source then it is known as anycasting. It is mainly used to get the content from any of the servers in the Content Delivery System.</p>
            <p><strong>Multicasting:</strong> If the message is sent to a subset of nodes from the source then it is known as multicasting. Used to send the same data to multiple receivers.</p>
            <p><strong>Broadcasting:</strong> If the message is sent to all the nodes in a network from a source then it is known as broadcasting. DHCP and ARP in the local network use broadcasting.</p>
